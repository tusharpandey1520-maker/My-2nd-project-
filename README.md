# My-2nd-project-
Excited to share my first project as a Python Programming Intern at Oasis Infobyte!

For Task 1, I developed a Voice Assistant using Python.

This project allowed me to dive into libraries like speech_recognition and pyttsx3 to create a tool that can listen to commands and respond.

Key Features:

Voice-to-text recognition.

Automated tasks like opening web browsers or telling the time.

Text-to-speech feedback for a natural user experience.

This was a fantastic introduction to how we can use Python to bridge the gap between human language and machine execution.
